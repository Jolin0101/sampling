    ```
Yes, the quality of the sample should be reasonably high. 
1. Stratified Random Samplint: The use of stratified random sampling ensures that both former emplyees and current emplyees are represented in the survey. This helpes in capturing the experiences and opinions from both groups, which is crucial for understanding the turnover issue comprehensively.
2. Comprehensive Sampling Frame: The sampling frame will include a complete list of all entry and lower-level employees who have left the complany in the past few months and those who are currently employed.
3. Representative Sampling units: By randomly selecting individuals from both strata, the sampling units are likely to be representative of the overall target population. Random sampling helps to minimize bias and ensures that every individual has an equal chance of being selected.

If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.
