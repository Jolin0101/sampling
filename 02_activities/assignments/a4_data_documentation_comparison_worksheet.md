|  | Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33) | Canadian Election Study Online Survey, 2019 | Trophic niche flexibility in Glossophaga soricina: how nectar seeker sneaks an insect snack |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sample type | Stratified design employing probability sampling. | "The online sample for the 2019 Canadian Election Study was composed of a two-wave panel with a modified rolling-cross section during the campaign period and a post-election recontact wave." | The study used guano samples collected from the bat species Glossophaga soricina and examined the DNA of insect fragments found within the guano. |
| Sample size | "Field sample: approximately 50,000 units. Invitation letters: about 40,000 sent. Expected completed questionnaires: 24,000." | "Pre-election survey: 37822 Post-election survey: 10337" | A total of 38 faecal samples from 112 G. soricina bats were analyzed. Out of these, 25 samples contained solid insect material, while the rest were liquid, indicating nectar consumption. |
| Target population | All persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada, excluding full-time residents of institutions. | Canadian citizens and permanent residents, aged 18 or older | The study targeted Glossophaga soricina, a species of bat, and their insect prey within the Area de ConservaciÃ³n de Guanacaste, Costa Rica. |
| Sampling frame | The sampling frame combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. | "1. cps19_weight_general_all - all campaign period respondents 2. cps19_weight_general_restricted - only high-quality campaign period respondents (see Data Quality section below) 3. pes19_weight_general_all - all post-election survey respondents 4. pes19_weight_general_restricted - only high-quality post-election survey respondents" | The sampling frame included all G. soricina bats captured in the Area de ConservaciÃ³n de Guanacaste during the study period. |
| Survey mode(s) | Electronic questionnaire or CATI (computer-assisted telephone interviewing) | Online survey | Field surveys, captive behavioural experiments, acoustic analyses and genetic methods |
| Timeline | "Collection period: Every 5 years, from September to December. Reference period: Past 12 months preceding the interview date." | "Campaign Period Survey: September 13th to October 21st, 2019 Post-election survey: October 24th to November 11th, 2019" | The field sampling was conducted over a 7-week period from late May to early July 2009. Behavioral experiments and data processing were carried out subsequently, but specific dates for these activities are not provided. |
| Response rate | 0.419 | "Pre-election survey: 45.48% Post-election survey: 61.62%" | Not applicable |
| Weights | Includes a weighting factor (WGHT_PER) for analysis at the person level. Bootstrap weights are also created for variance estimation. | "Weights have been created for the dataset using an iterative ""raking'' process, as provided by the ipfraking command in STATA15. Marginal values were successively weighted according to province, as well as gender, age group, and education level. All population data were taken from the 2016 Canadian census. A maximum of 200 iterations were completed. The dataset includes the weights produced as 4 variables, depending on which portion of the sample is being used:  1. cps19_weight_general_all - all campaign period respondents 2. cps19_weight_general_restricted - only high-quality campaign period respondents (see Data Quality section below) 3. pes19_weight_general_all - all post-election survey respondents 4. pes19_weight_general_restricted - only high-quality post-election survey respondents Note that respondents from the territories do not have weights, as they were not included in the sampling frame, because data collection in the territories is too sparse to be representative." | Not applicable |
| Data processing | "Data were edited and cleaned through automated and manual processes. Imputations were made using donor records and mean imputation where necessary. Error detection and processing were done using the SSPE set of generalized processing steps and utilities." | "The data processing involved multiple steps, including: Cleaning: Removing incomplete or inconsistent responses. Imputation: Addressing missing data points through statistical methods. Identification of duplicates: Ensuring each respondent's data was unique and no multiple submissions from the same individual were included." | "DNA Extraction and Analysis Behavioral Data Echolocation Call Parameters" |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc. | Imputations were carried out in nine steps using donor records and mean imputation. Personal income was obtained through tax data linkage for 81.9% of respondents, and missing information was imputed. | Removal criteria; Identification of duplicates | "DNA Analysis: Insect DNA sequences were compared to reference databases, and sequences without exact matches were considered preliminary hypotheses. Behavioral Analysis: Recorded attacks were classified into 'flower-like' and 'insect-like' categories based on video playback." |
| Sources of error | Includes sampling error, coverage error, non-response error, response error, and processing error. Non-sampling errors were minimized through adjustments to survey weights and other measures. | Internal survey testing; Ineligible - no consent; Ineligible - not citizen or PR; Ineligible - under 18 ; over quota; incomplete quota demographics; Incomplete core; Subsequent duplicate; Speeder, Postalcode-provide mismatch; Subsequent duplicate; Speeder; Postalcode-province mismatch; Straightliner; Inattentive | "DNA Analysis: Incomplete reference databases could lead to incorrect or preliminary identification of insect species. Behavioral Experiments: The captive colony's naivety to insects might affect their natural behavior, potentially limiting the applicability of findings to wild bats. Echolocation Studies: Environmental factors and calibration errors in the recording equipment could affect the accuracy of call parameter measurements." |
| Limitations, known biases | Coverage errors due to exclusion of households without telephones. Non-response bias was addressed through adjustments to survey weights and linkage to administrative data for non-responding households. | Known biases could include underrepresentation or overrepresentation of certain demographic groups, response bias, and the limitations of self-reported data. The online nature of the survey might also exclude individuals without internet access. | "Dietary Analysis: The reliance on guano and reference sequences means some prey species might be underrepresented if they are not in the reference database. Behavioral Experiments: The captive environment may not fully replicate natural conditions, potentially affecting the bats' behavior. Detection Distance Modeling: The use of fixed hearing thresholds for moths and potential bias in target strength measurements might affect the accuracy of detection distance estimates." |
